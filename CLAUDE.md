# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the app

```bash
python3 -m presence          # from the repo root (requires GTK4)
presence-cli input.md        # headless CLI, no GTK required
```

## Running tests

```bash
pytest                                      # all tests (runs tests/)
pytest tests/test_slides.py                 # single file
pytest tests/test_slides.py::test_split_basic  # single test
```

## Installing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"      # editable install with dev dependencies
```


## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Use dataclasses for data models
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting
- Use pathlib for file paths

## Conventions
- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Strict adherence to GNOME HIG for UI/UX decisions

## Architecture

The codebase lives entirely under `src/presence/` and splits into two layers:

**`src/presence/slides/`** — pure library, no GTK dependency. Pipeline:

1. `frontmatter.py` — strips and parses YAML frontmatter from the top of the document.
2. `splitter.py` — splits Markdown into per-slide strings on `---` separators; also handles `|||` (two-column split), `^^^` (speaker notes), image layout tokens in alt-text, and title-slide detection. All operations work on raw strings only.
3. `renderer.py` — converts Markdown fragments to HTML using `markdown-it-py` with optional Pygments syntax highlighting.
4. `css.py` — builds the full CSS string from a `Theme` object via `build_css(theme, width, height, logo_b64)`. Colour values from theme files are validated against an allowlist to prevent CSS injection.
5. `html.py` — assembles the complete HTML document; dispatches to per-slide-type renderers (`_render_title_slide`, `_render_normal_slide`, `_render_image_slide`, `_render_two_image_slide`).
6. `themes.py` / `theme_loader.py` — `Theme` dataclass and discovery of theme directories.
7. `thumbnails.py` / `thumbnails_render.py` — PDF-to-thumbnail rendering.

**`src/presence/`** (GTK 4 / Libadwaita frontend):

- `application.py` / `window.py` — app lifecycle and main window.
- `editor.py` — GtkSourceView-based Markdown editor with slide-number badges in the gutter.
- `converter.py` — `Converter(GObject.Object)` runs conversion on a background thread; emits `conversion-started / conversion-complete / conversion-failed` GObject signals and handles watch-mode polling.
- `sidebar.py` — thumbnail strip.
- `presenter.py` — presenter view (current slide + notes + timer).
- `theme_panel.py` / `theme_editor.py` / `theme_manager_ui.py` — theme browser and editor UI.
- `session.py` — persistence: window state, recent files, editor prefs, recovery files.

## Slide syntax (key separators)

| Syntax | Effect |
|---|---|
| `---` on its own line | Slide separator |
| `\|\|\|` on its own line | Two-column split within a slide |
| `^^^` on its own line | Speaker notes separator |
| `![alt\|pos\|size](src)` | Image with layout tokens in alt-text |

## Theme system

Themes live in `~/.local/share/presence/themes/` (user) or the system data dir. Each theme is a directory containing `theme.json` and optionally font files and a `custom.css`. Colour values in `theme.json` are validated in `css.py` before interpolation into CSS.
